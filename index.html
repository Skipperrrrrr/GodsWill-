<section id='our-story'><h2>Our Story</h2><p>
We met in the university. We were both 17 . I was in second year and she was a fresher. We met because we were supposed to start a Bacenta on campus together. I mean we started the Bacenta 😅 but as we kept the fellowship going on our hearts grew fonder 🥹❤️. Before we knew it, I enjoyed spending more time with her than even my books😭. Unreasonable but magical💕. It wasn’t typically love at first sight but I love how long it took for you to start telling me “I haven’t heard from you the whole day”. Every day for four years, I thought about you, I came to your room, I ate your food, I tried to make you laugh😅 and I laughed at you even more only to realized that I had melted to the ground; fallen so much in love no one could pick me up.<br><br>On the 5th of July, 2022, I popped the question (not the biggest one but the phrase still works😂😂). Fast forward, it’s been three years and I still really like you. I imagine what happy ever after with you will be like and teaching our 18 year old child how to drive and I imagine what “Kwaku and Lorrie’s 50th anniversary would be and I know only one person I see myself doing this with; YOU.<br><br><br><br>I remember one fun memory; we went to Hillview hotel to just sit and chill. We were well aware that bringing food from outside wasn’t not allowed but we came in confidently with our Waakye😂 and found a way to eat it Im plain sight. At every point I was very worried that we’d get caught but I was encouraging you to feel free and eat😂😂😂. The only thing we did right was to buy coke and lime from them to give them the assurance that we were with them. I loved doing that with you.<br><br><br><br>I’ll forever laugh at your English even though technically you understand and know way more words than I do😭😂😂.

<section id='where-going'><h2>Where We're Going</h2><p>
I want to be able to go on trips with her all around the world especially to the tropical places because that’s what she really loves. Zanzibar, Korea, Brazil, the US, Maldives, Santorini, Bermuda island, Jamaica,the Caribbeans and last but not least Switzerland.<br><br><br><br>I see a happy marriage because I chose to be with her and no one else and I’ll like to let her know that I’d chose her if even she was a twin.<br><br><br><br>I see a home with her as our spiritual covering, teaching the kids to love the Lord and serve Him, where she’s her husband’s (biggest support).<br><br><br><br>A home with our twins, Nyameye and Adom
